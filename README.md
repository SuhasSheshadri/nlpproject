Diagnostics for language models

Project Description:

Main Task : Establish a metric to grade the knowledge of the trained language model on chosen topics.   

This project intends to select and implement a language representation model (if time permits two) with a provided corpus. The main part is to explore the possibility of competence metrics to determine how much a model knows within a certain topic that is specified.


Project Plan:

Study various semantic models trained from text.
Select one model and implement it.
Train the model with the provided corpus.
Implement a metric to distinguish content word relations.
Perform evaluation.
Train another model and repeat steps 4 and 5.
